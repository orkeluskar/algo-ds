## Introduction

This is my javascript implementation of Algorithms & Data Structures



## Getting Started

Since, this is written in JavaScript, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orkeluskar/algo-ds.git
   ```

2. Change directory
   ```bash
   cd algo-ds
   ```

3. Test the code?
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```



## Project Structure

- `/lib` - Contains all the necessary Data Structures like [Linked Lists](./lib/ListNode.js), [TreeNode](./lib/TreeNode.js) etc.
- `/test` - Contains all the necessary test cases
- Rest of the directories are named according to the aggregation of algorithm problems
  - Also, each file contains a commented block to explain the problem
